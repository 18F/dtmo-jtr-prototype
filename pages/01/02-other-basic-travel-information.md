The following information applies to all travelers, unless noted otherwise.

### 010201. Key Participants

Official travel involves the participation of three key players: the traveler, authorizing or approving official, and the Travel Management Company (TMC).

<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Travelers</u>. A traveler is anyone who travels on official business for DoD. Travelers fall into three groups: Service members, civilian employees, and other travelers. JTR allowances may differ among these groups due to law or other regulations.

	</li>
	<li><u>Authorizing or Approving Official (AOs)</u>. An AO determines whether travel is necessary and appropriate to the mission, ensures that all expenses claimed by the traveler are valid, and authorizes or approves the expenses if they are valid. Expenses must not be approved if they are inflated, inaccurate, or higher than normal for similar services in the locality. If the JTR indicates an expense, allowance, or other item must or may be authorized (such as the mode of transportation), it means the AO must give permission before the action takes place. Likewise, if the JTR indicates “may or must be approved,” then the AO may or must give the traveler permission after the action takes place.</li>
	<li><u>TMC</u>. The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for DoD travelers. The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for travelers from other Federal agencies. A GSA TMC may be used only when a DTMO-contracted TMC is not available.
		<ol>
			<li>A DoD traveler must make travel arrangements through an electronic travel system when it is available or through the TMC if it is not available. Any DoD traveler who cannot reach the TMC must contact the AO or designee for assistance. However, lodging may be reserved outside the TMC when arranging for a large number of rooms in advance, such as for training courses, exercises, or conferences, or when safety, health, or security concerns require using specific lodging establishments.</li>
			<li>The TMC will book a traveler only for economy travel and economy accommodations. However, a traveler may upgrade travel or accommodations at personal expense. Under certain circumstances described in the JTR, other accommodations may be authorized or approved.</li>
			<li>A traveler, AO, or electronic system must provide the TMC a copy of the travel authorization before ticketing. However, a TMC may issue tickets for official travel authorized by proper verbal, letter, or message authority if travel must begin or is performed before a written travel authorization issued. The AO is responsible for providing a confirmatory travel authorization to the TMC.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

### 010202. Requirement to Travel

Travel is required when other means of conducting business, such as telephone calls or video teleconferencing, are unavailable or cannot meet the mission’s needs. This must be certified in a statement on the travel authorization. Government-funded travel and transportation are used only when officially justified and by the means that meet mission requirements consistent with good management.

### 010203. Travel Status
The travel authorization establishes when travel status starts and ends. A traveler is authorized travel and transportation allowances only while in a travel status. A travel status begins when a traveler leaves the PDS, residence, or office, or when he or she detaches from or signs out of a unit or agency. It ends when the traveler returns to the PDS, residence, or office, or when he or she arrives at a new PDS by signing in with the new unit or agency.

<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Travel Status Qualifiers</u>. A travel status includes:
		<ol>
			<li>Time spent away from the PDS on public business under a valid travel authorization.</li>
			<li>Necessary TDY travel. This includes time spent at a TDY location, regardless of whether duty is performed while traveling or how much time is spent away from the PDS.</li>
			<li>PCS travel.</li>
			<li>Necessary delays while awaiting further transportation after travel status begins.</li>
			<li>Travel to or from a hospital or medical facility for observation or treatment.</li>
			<li>Travel by Government or other aircraft, including flights for training purposes made under a valid travel authorization that requires one or more landings away from the starting point.</li>
			<li>Flights for training purposes made in the absence of a travel authorization when it is necessary to remain away overnight.</li>
			<li>Other circumstances determined jointly by the Secretaries concerned before, during, or after an occurrence that constitutes a travel status.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><u>Alternative Departure Points</u>. A traveler may be authorized or approved to begin and end at the following places when it is to the Government’s advantage:
		<ol>
			<li>Traveler’s residence when the traveler commutes from there daily to the PDS.</li>
			<li>Location at which the traveler maintains the family residence if it is not the residence from which the traveler commutes daily to the PDS.</li>
			<li>Place near the traveler’s residence where the privately owned vehicle (POV) is garaged or stored.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><u>Travelers Other than Aircrew Member and Courier</u>. See Table 1-2 to determine when the travel status begins and ends for a traveler who is not an aircrew member or courier.

	<li><u>Aircrew Member and Courier Status</u>. A Service member performing TDY as an aircrew member includes a Service member for whom aircrew duty is an additional duty. It also includes an Armed Forces courier or other Service member whose primary duty makes the air terminal a regular duty place. This does not apply to an RC member for first and last day when called to active duty. Aircrew member status for an RC member only applies after the RC member arrives at the active duty location and terminates when the RC member departs upon relief from active duty. See Table 1-4 to determine when the travel status begins and ends for an aircrew member or courier.

A traveler is required to use the GTCC to obtain travel advances and to pay for all official travel expenses. A traveler may be exempted from this requirement under certain circumstances. See the <ins><a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_09.pdf">DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9</a></ins> (Travel Policy) dated June 2015, for travel advances when the traveler is not issued a GTCC. Advance funds for certain travel and transportation allowances are authorized in law (see <ins><a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/515431_vol04.pdf">DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 4</a></ins> (GTCC).

<h3 id="010205-dts-use">010205. Defense Travel System (DTS) Use</h3>

DoD travelers and AOs must use the DTS to process travel authorizations and vouchers for TDY travel and local travel. A traveler must use the DTS to the maximum extent possible to arrange all en route transportation, rental cars, commercial lodging, and Government quarters when the DTS’s functionality is available. See <ins><a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/515431_vol03.pdf">DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 3</a></ins> (DTS). The TMC processes reservations made in the DTS.

### 010206. Travel Authorizations and Orders
Travel and transportation allowances are payable only after valid orders are issued. The order directs travel to, from, or between official points and serves as the basis for the trip and associated reimbursements. A travel authorization or order should be issued before travel begins. Travel or expenses incurred before a travel authorization or order is issued are not reimbursable, unless otherwise stated in the JTR. In unusual or urgent situations when travel must begin before a written authorization or order can be issued, a verbal authorization may be given. In such cases, the verbal authorization must be followed up in writing (called a “confirmatory order”) before allowances are paid. A travel order may only contain authority for travel and transportation allowances provided within the JTR. If there is any conflict between a travel order and the JTR, the JTR prevails.
<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Modifications after Travel</u>. Travel authorizations and orders cannot be retroactively modified to increase or decrease an allowance after the travel is completed. A travel authorization or order may be retroactively corrected to show the original intent (CBCA 3472-RELO, September 23, 2013)). When an allowance is approved after travel begins, it does not constitute a retroactive modification to create, change, or deny an allowance. An amendment is effective on the date it is issued and is not retroactive unless it contains language that corrects an error or omission, or provides a confirmation of the date of the verbal authorization.</li>
	<li><u>Time Limits for Travel Authorizations and Orders</u>. See Table 1-6 for rules that define the time restrictions for travel allowances. Requests for a TDY that exceeds 180 days at one location should be made in advance of travel to the authority identified in Table 1-7. The requests must be made in writing and contain justification for the length of the TDY. When the TDY exceeds 180 consecutive days without being authorized or approved, per diem stops on the 181st day.
	[table 1-6]
	</li>
	<li><u>Violation of 180-Day Rule</u>. Issuing a TDY order for 180, or fewer, consecutive days, followed by a brief return to the PDS and then another TDY order for return to the same location, is a violation of the 180-consecutive-day policy if the known, or reasonably anticipated, TDY duration exceeded 180 days when the initial order was issued.
		<div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info">
			<div class="usa-alert-body">
				<p class="usa-alert-text">Exceeding the 180-day consecutive TDY time limit without authorization and approval does not constitute an automatic PCS.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		[table 1-7]
	</li>
	<li><u>TDY Travel Authorization or Order Issued Before Request to Exceed 180 Days Is Received</u>
		<ol>
			<li>If the mission does not permit obtaining the authorization to exceed 180 days before the order is issued, the travel authorization or order may be issued and the request submitted immediately to the appropriate authority listed above. That authority must perform one of the following:
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Approve the authorization or order as written.</li>
					<li>Direct that the authorization or order be amended to:
						<ol>
							<li>End the duty and return the traveler to the PDS or assign a new PDS.</li>
							<li>Change the assignment from TDY to a PCS.</li>
							<li>Set the period at 180 or fewer days from the TDY report date.</li>
							<li>Authorize a temporary change of station (TCS) if the traveler is a civilian employee and ensure that the tax information is listed in the Remarks section of the TDY order for that civilian employee. A TCS is a temporary relocation of a civilian employee to a new PDS on long-term assignment and subsequent return to the previous PDS after assignment completion.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>See Chapter 3, Part C for information on civilian employees deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq in support of ongoing contingency operations.</li>
					<li>For civilian employees, if a TDY will last between 6 months and 30 months, the AO must determine before the travel begins whether the assignment is actually temporary or should be a PCS. If the assignment is determined to be temporary, the AO must then determine if the duty should be a TCS or a TDY. For an assignment to be designated TDY, it must meet all of the following criteria:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Duties are temporary in nature.</li>
							<li>Assignment is for a reasonable period of time.</li>
							<li>TDY costs are lower than round-trip TCS or PCS expenses.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>If the AO determines that a TCS is appropriate for the civilian employee, the civilian employee should see Chapter 5.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
