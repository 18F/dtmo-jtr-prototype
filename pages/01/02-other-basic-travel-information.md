The following information applies to all travelers, unless noted otherwise.

### 010201. Key Participants

Official travel involves the participation of three key players: the traveler, authorizing or approving official, and the Travel Management Company (TMC).

<ol type="A">

	<li><u>Travelers</u>. A traveler is anyone who travels on official business for DoD. Travelers fall into three groups: Service members, civilian employees, and other travelers. JTR allowances may differ among these groups due to law or other regulations.

	</li>
	<li><u>Authorizing or Approving Official (AOs)</u>. An AO determines whether travel is necessary and appropriate to the mission, ensures that all expenses claimed by the traveler are valid, and authorizes or approves the expenses if they are valid. Expenses must not be approved if they are inflated, inaccurate, or higher than normal for similar services in the locality. If the JTR indicates an expense, allowance, or other item must or may be authorized (such as the mode of transportation), it means the AO must give permission before the action takes place. Likewise, if the JTR indicates “may or must be approved,” then the AO may or must give the traveler permission after the action takes place.</li>
	<li><u>TMC</u>. The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for DoD travelers. The General Services Administration (GSA) contracts with TMCs to make travel arrangements for travelers from other Federal agencies. A GSA TMC may be used only when a DTMO-contracted TMC is not available.
		<ol>
			<li>A DoD traveler must make travel arrangements through an electronic travel system when it is available or through the TMC if it is not available. Any DoD traveler who cannot reach the TMC must contact the AO or designee for assistance. However, lodging may be reserved outside the TMC when arranging for a large number of rooms in advance, such as for training courses, exercises, or conferences, or when safety, health, or security concerns require using specific lodging establishments.</li>
			<li>The TMC will book a traveler only for economy travel and economy accommodations. However, a traveler may upgrade travel or accommodations at personal expense. Under certain circumstances described in the JTR, other accommodations may be authorized or approved.</li>
			<li>A traveler, AO, or electronic system must provide the TMC a copy of the travel authorization before ticketing. However, a TMC may issue tickets for official travel authorized by proper verbal, letter, or message authority if travel must begin or is performed before a written travel authorization issued. The AO is responsible for providing a confirmatory travel authorization to the TMC.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

### 010202. Requirement to Travel

Travel is required when other means of conducting business, such as telephone calls or video teleconferencing, are unavailable or cannot meet the mission’s needs. This must be certified in a statement on the travel authorization. Government-funded travel and transportation are used only when officially justified and by the means that meet mission requirements consistent with good management.

### 010203. Travel Status
The travel authorization establishes when travel status starts and ends. A traveler is authorized travel and transportation allowances only while in a travel status. A travel status begins when a traveler leaves the PDS, residence, or office, or when he or she detaches from or signs out of a unit or agency. It ends when the traveler returns to the PDS, residence, or office, or when he or she arrives at a new PDS by signing in with the new unit or agency.

<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Travel Status Qualifiers</u>. A travel status includes:
		<ol>
			<li>Time spent away from the PDS on public business under a valid travel authorization.</li>
			<li>Necessary TDY travel. This includes time spent at a TDY location, regardless of whether duty is performed while traveling or how much time is spent away from the PDS.</li>
			<li>PCS travel.</li>
			<li>Necessary delays while awaiting further transportation after travel status begins.</li>
			<li>Travel to or from a hospital or medical facility for observation or treatment.</li>
			<li>Travel by Government or other aircraft, including flights for training purposes made under a valid travel authorization that requires one or more landings away from the starting point.</li>
			<li>Flights for training purposes made in the absence of a travel authorization when it is necessary to remain away overnight.</li>
			<li>Other circumstances determined jointly by the Secretaries concerned before, during, or after an occurrence that constitutes a travel status.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><u>Alternative Departure Points</u>. A traveler may be authorized or approved to begin and end at the following places when it is to the Government’s advantage:
		<ol>
			<li>Traveler’s residence when the traveler commutes from there daily to the PDS.</li>
			<li>Location at which the traveler maintains the family residence if it is not the residence from which the traveler commutes daily to the PDS.</li>
			<li>Place near the traveler’s residence where the privately owned vehicle (POV) is garaged or stored.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><u>Travelers Other than Aircrew Member and Courier</u>. See Table 1-2 to determine when the travel status begins and ends for a traveler who is not an aircrew member or courier.
