### 010301. Receipt Requirements

<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Retain Receipts</u>. Travelers are advised to retain ALL receipts for tax or other purposes. <ins><a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_09.pdf">DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9</a></ins> (Travel Policy) dated June 2015, and <ins><a href="http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/515431_vol03.pdf">DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 3</a></ins> (DTS), require an itemized receipt for each lodging expense, regardless of the amount, and any individual expenditure of $75 or more. AOs are discouraged from requiring additional receipts except to substantiate reimbursement if a travelerâ€™s claim contains doubtful reimbursement.</li>
	<li><u>Lost Receipts</u>. If a receipt is impracticable to obtain or has been inadvertently lost or destroyed, a lost receipt statement explaining the circumstances and containing the same information as the lost receipt must be furnished.</li>

### 010302. Duplicate Payments and Fraudulent Claims

<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Duplicate Payments</u>. A traveler cannot be reimbursed more than once for the same allowance or expense. The Government does not pay expenses reimbursed, or to be reimbursed, by another entity. The traveler must repay any such duplicate payments to the Government.</li>
	<li><u>Fraudulent Claims</u>. If a reasonable suspicion of a falsified expense for lodging, meals, or incidental expenses exists and the suspicion is identified before the traveler is reimbursed, the applicable per diem or AEA is denied for the entire day for which the suspected expense is claimed. If there is reasonable suspicion of a falsified expense other than the cost of lodging, meals, or incidental expenses, the suspicious expense is denied.</li>
</ol>
