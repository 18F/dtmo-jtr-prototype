### 010101. Travel Categories

The categories of travel addressed in the JTR are:

<ol type="A">
	<li>Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel.</li>
	<li>Government-funded Leave Travel.</li>
	<li>Local Travel at the Permanent Duty Station (PDS).</li>
	<li>Permanent Duty Travel (PDT), including Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Travel. E. Evacuation Travel.</li>
</ol>

### 010102. Guiding Principle
The guiding principle behind the JTR is to travel responsibly. The word “responsibly” means that the traveler exercises the same care in incurring expenses for Government travel that a prudent person would exercise if traveling at personal expense.

### 010103. Traveler Responsibilities
<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Financial Responsibility</u>. Traveling responsibly includes using the least expensive transportation mode, parking facilities, public transportation, or rental vehicle. It also includes scheduling travel as early as possible to take advantage of discounted transportation rates. The traveler is financially responsible for excess costs, circuitous routes, delays, or luxury accommodations that are unnecessary or unjustified.</li>
	<li><u>Items Not Mentioned</u>. If something is not stated in the JTR, it does not mean that an allowance exists or may be authorized. The philosophy of “It doesn’t say I can’t; therefore, I can” does not apply to the JTR. Instead, if the JTR does not say something can be reimbursed, then it cannot be reimbursed as a travel claim.</li>
	<li><u>Ethics Regulations and Rules</u>. The traveler must comply with Federal ethics laws, DoD 5500.07-R (Joint Ethics Regulation) and the Agency’s or Service’s ethics regulations and rules. Rules pertaining to acceptance of travel and transportation benefits, including gifts, favors, and special accommodations from non-Federal sources must be followed.</li>
</ol>

### 010104. Service or Agency Responsibilities
<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Mission Controls</u>. Each Service or DoD Agency must authorize or approve only the travel necessary to accomplish the Government’s mission effectively and economically while establishing internal controls to ensure that only such travel is authorized. An official responsible for directing travel or approving reimbursement is also responsible for ensuring that funds are used for official travel purposes and in accordance with the conditions prescribed in the JTR. A statement must be included on the travel authorization specifying that alternate means, such as Secure Video-Teleconference or other Web-based communication are insufficient to accomplish travel objectives.</li>
	<li><u>Traveler Rights</u>. Unless stated otherwise in the JTR, the Service or Agency cannot reduce allowances or deny reimbursements because of limited DoD travel funds. In addition, a Service or Agency cannot direct a traveler to travel at personal expense or at reimbursement rates or amounts inconsistent with the JTR.</li>
</ol>
