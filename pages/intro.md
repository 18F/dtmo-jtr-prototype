### Authority, Applicability, and Administration of the JTR

The JTR implements policy and laws establishing travel and transportation allowances of Uniformed Service members and Department of Defense (DoD) civilian travelers. It also implements station and certain other allowances. The JTR has the force and effect of law for travelers, and implements statutory regulations and law for DoD civilian travelers. Organizations are expected to take appropriate disciplinary action when travelers willfully fail to follow the JTR. However, unless stated otherwise in the JTR, the disciplinary action cannot be in the form of refusal to pay appropriate travel and transportation allowances.

#### The JTR applies to:

- Uniformed Service Active and Reserve Component members and their dependents. The Uniformed Services are the U.S. Army (USA), U.S. Navy (USN), U.S. Air Force (USAF), U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS).
- DoD civilian employees and their dependents.
- Other authorized travelers who use appropriated DoD funding, including new DoD Senior
Executive Service appointees and certain Presidential appointees.
- DoD personal services contract employees.

#### The JTR does not apply to:
- Contractor employees under a DoD contract for anything other than personal services.
- DoD employees appointed under Title 22 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 2385(d).
- DoD civilian employees performing official assignments funded by a non-DoD Agency who are
subject to that Agency’s travel and transportation policies.
- Government employees whose salaries are paid with non-appropriated funds (NAF) traveling on
NAF business.
- Foreign personnel traveling under Security Assistance Management Manual authority.


Nothing in the JTR authorizes expenditures for purposes not provided for in Congressional appropriations or in law. This publication is issued under the authority of <ins>[DoDI 5154.31](http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/515431_vol05.pdf), Vol. 5 (Commercial Travel Management: PDTATAC)</ins>. Travelers and travel officials must adhere strictly to the JTR. The traveler could be personally financially responsible for any expense accrued by not complying with the JTR. When the General Services Administration’s Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) authorizes a discretionary travel and transportation allowance that the JTR does not address, the allowance is not authorized or implemented within the DoD.

### Responsibility for the JTR
The Per Diem, Travel, and Transportation Allowance Committee (PDTATAC) updates and publishes the JTR. The PDTATAC is composed of a Chair and a member representing the Departments of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Commerce. The Committee Chair is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy.

Each Uniformed Service has a representative on the <ins>[Military Advisory Panel (MAP)](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/pdcContacts.pdf) and the [Civilian Advisory Panel (CAP)](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/pdcContacts.pdf)</ins>. The MAP consists of a representative from each of the Uniformed Services. The CAP consists of a civilian representative from each of the Military Services and the OSD Washington Headquarters Services. The MAP and CAP members report to senior leaders of the Uniformed Services, who serve as members of the PDTATAC.

### Effective Date of Regulation Changes
A change to the JTR is effective, unless otherwise noted, on its first publication date. This date appears in the lower left corner of each page. When an effective date is different from the date of first publication, that effective date is indicated.

### Interpretation of These Regulations and Their Underlying Laws and Regulations

DoD certifying officer or disbursing officer may request an advance decision, in accordance with
<ins>[DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 9 (Travel Policy)](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_09.pdf)</ins>, on a claim whose validity or amount is questionable. An Accountable Officer desiring an advance decision on an issue involving the interpretation of the JTR must forward the request for an advance decision through PDTATAC. A traveler who disagrees with a decision by a certifying officer may submit an appeal or reclaim in accordance with DoDFMR, Vol. 9."

In cases of specific travel circumstances in need of clarification, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense (GC DoD), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) (for a Service member), and the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) (for a civilian employee) determine how the JTR, the Federal Travel Regulation (for civilian employees), and departmental instructions should be interpreted.

Decisions by the GC DoD, DOHA, CBCA (formerly called the General Services Board of Contract Appeals), and the U.S. Government Accountability Office provide guidance for similar cases or situations involving the same circumstances. These decisions are referenced in the JTR, where applicable.

#### Questions, Suggestions, or Recommendations

Submitted questions concerning information in the JTR or suggestions for improvements or recommendations for changes must go through Command channels to the respective Service or Agency PDTATAC representative.

### Service or DoD Agency Regulation Review Process

Services or Agencies may issue related administrative procedures provided they do not conflict with or unnecessarily duplicate JTR provisions. <ins>[DoDI 5154.31, Vol. 5](http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/515431_vol05.pdf) (Commercial Travel Management: PDTATAC)</ins> requires that PDTATAC staff review all DoD written material that implements JTR provisions to ensure that per diem, travel, and transportation allowances, relocation allowances, and certain other allowances are uniformly applied. The review process applies to all DoD Uniformed Services and DoD Agencies. In addition, the USCG, NOAA, and USPHS may submit written material for review as desired. A Service or Agency submitting written material to the PDTATAC must first send the document to its MAP or CAP representative.
